# bamazon #

*This is a node based application where the user can access MySQL database from the terminal to view various products for sale <br/>
Running the bamazonLogic.js file shows the user all the items available for purchase. From here, inquirer prompts the user to select the id of the product they would like to purchase. Conditionals are set to ensure the user selects a valid ID and enters a valid amount (cannot request more than the amount available). Once the user has finished "shopping", the connection ends.
