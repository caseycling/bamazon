# bamazon #

*This is a node based application where the user can access MySQL database to view various products for sale 
*Running the bamazonLogic.js file shows the user all the items available for purchase

*From here, inquirer prompts the user to select the id of the product they would like to purchase

*If the item id does not exist, then the user is prompted to choose a valid id

*If it does exist, they are then asked to enter the amount they would like to purchase

*If they enter too much, the user is told to enter a valid amount

*At the end, they are given their total and asked if they would like to make another purchase

*If they would, the app starts over

*If not, they are thanked and the connection ends
